# React Step-by-Step Guide App

## Overview

The React Step-by-Step Guide App is a simple application that provides a step-by-step guide with messages. This project demonstrates key React concepts, including state management using the `useState` hook, conditional rendering, and handling user interactions.

## Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. State Management with `useState`

- The `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the current step (`step`) and the visibility of the guide (`isOpen`).

### 2. Conditional Rendering

- The visibility of the step-by-step guide is controlled by the `isOpen` state.
- Different steps and messages are rendered conditionally based on the current step value.

### 3. Handling User Interactions

- Buttons for "Previous" and "Next" steps are provided, and their behavior is controlled by the `handlePrevious` and `handleNext` functions.
- Clicking the "Close" button toggles the visibility of the entire guide.

## Usage

1. Click the "Close" button to toggle the visibility of the step-by-step guide.
2. Navigate through the steps using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

## Styling

- Simple styling is applied to the buttons, emphasizing the active step and providing a visually appealing user interface.

## Running the Application

To use this React app, include the `App` component in your project. Make sure to manage the styles and dependencies as needed.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useState } from "react";

// ... (Include the rest of your code)

export default function YourComponent() {
  // ... (Render the App component or integrate the logic as needed)
}
